## Introduction

\--- Finance is a decentralized non-custodial money market and liquidity staking protocol which allows users to participate as suppliers or borrowers on the DFK Chain. Our goal is to offer users of DFK Chain more liquidity options/incentives so they can employ their assets/capital on DFK Chain ecosystem. <mark style="color:red;">(option I)</mark>\

\--- Finance is a decentralized non-custodial money market and liquidity staking protocol on DFK Chain that allows users to supply and borrow assets, while receiving or paying interest in a completely permissionless and decentralized way. Borrowing and lending interest is set based on market demand, and loans are over-collateralized to ensure solvency. We aim to provide users within the DFK Chain with additional liquidity options and incentives, enabling them to leverage/employ their assets and capital within the DFK Chain ecosystem. <mark style="color:red;">(option II)</mark>

One of the functions we will be focusing on is providing Liquid staking derivatives (LSD) in the form of stJewel, where the users would stake their Jewel on our protocol and get rewards from both Jeweler in DefiKingdoms in the form of Jewel as well as our own platform native token Sapphire. For providing this service protocol charges a fixed fee of 10% from all the staking rewards (NOT the total staked Jewel amount).<mark style="color:red;">(option I)</mark>

We will concentrate on offering Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) in the form of stJewel as a key function. In this setup, users stake their Jewel within our protocol and receive rewards from both the Jeweler in DefiKingdoms in the form of Jewel and our native platform token, Sapphire. In exchange for this service, the protocol applies a fixed fee of 10% on all staking rewards (NOT the total staked Jewel amount).<mark style="color:red;">(option II)</mark>

Focus of the protocol will be set on the idea that suppliers provide liquidity to the protocol to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow from the protocol by perpetually overcollateralizing, at a borrowing cost. By doing so we are giving alternative options to the users on the chain to employ their capital through our protocol and its derivatives, while also making sure that the circular economy makes protocol self sustainable.

By providing liquidity or acquiring xSapphire the users will earn --- Finance native token, named Sapphire. \
Sapphire and xSapphire are designed to serve various purposes, yet their applications on protocol are entirely different.

## Why we are here

We decided to enter this project with the idea to provide a service that is a lifeline for every well established ecosystem or chain, what our protocol aims to resolve will be further explained in this whitepaper.\
As passionate gamers and group of developers that has been active and involved with DefiKindgoms project since the early days of its inception, we are aware of its immense potential it posses but we also have a clear vision how we can further improve and what services are missing on the DFK Chain.\
One of the reasons we choose to build DFK Chain as developers is our belief in vision of the people that stand behind Kingdom Studios and subsequently DFK Chain, a chain that is built on AVAX subnet.\
We are firm believers that future of gaming is in the web3 world that encompasses DeFi and GameFi together.\
