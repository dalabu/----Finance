# What is DeFi money market ?

In order to understand mission behind --- Finance we first need to understand what decentralized money markets are.

Decentralized finance ecosystems revolutionize traditional financial paradigms by enabling users to participate in on-chain borrowing and lending of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, through a seamless Internet connection.

At the heart of a flourishing economy lies the crucial capability to deploy idle capital efficiently. This empowers individuals to access funds for business expansion and expenses, while also creating avenues for others to lend cryptocurrencies, earning yields to enhance their savings. To meet these vital financial needs, cryptocurrency-infused money markets act as dynamic platforms connecting borrowers and lenders, fostering significant economic activity.

Despite the evolving landscape of financial markets, the fundamental purpose and structure of decentralized money markets persist. Borrowers utilize these markets to secure short-term loans (typically under a year) by offering one cryptocurrency (e.g., Jewel) while pledging another cryptocurrency (e.g., stable coins) as collateral. This collateral functions as a protective measure in case of borrower default, as it can be liquidated to reimburse the lender. Alternatively, the collateral is returned upon full repayment of the loan by the borrower. It's crucial to note that borrowers can only access funds/loans by perpetually overcollateralizing in this manner.\
If you are wondering whats the point of taking a loan if you have to supply tokens that are worth more then the actual amount of the loan taken, why wouldn't you just sell you asset in the first place and buy the other asset that is valued less at that given moment ?\
We might mention few reasons why users would decide not to sell the assets:

* not wanting to sell their assets but they need to cover their expenses
* think their collateralized assets will increase in the future but need the liquidity
* avoiding or delaying capital gain taxes
* wanting to increase their leverage in the certain position

In exchange for accessing working capital from lenders, borrowers incur a fee, often denoted as an annual interest rate, payable in cryptocurrency. This fee generates yield for lenders and encourages deposits. The interest rate is typically dictated by supply and demand dynamics within the cryptocurrency market, ensuring sufficient liquidity for both borrowers and lenders. An excess of supply and a shortfall of demand result in lower interest rates, while a scarcity of supply and heightened demand lead to higher interest rates. Competition among various cryptocurrency-driven money markets centers not only on the interest rates offered but also on parameters such as collateral requirements for loans.
