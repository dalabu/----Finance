# What is the purpose of --- Finance

\--- Finance is a first algorithmic money market protocol with a DEX on the DFK Chain. It allows users to swap, supply and borrow assets, while receiving or paying interest in a completely permissionless and decentralized way. Borrowing and lending interest rates are based on market demand of the Sapphire token. All loans are over-collateralized to ensure solvency.

\--- Finance's vision is to be the first and leading money market protocol on DFK Chain to provide services of supplying and borrowing different assets in DFK Chain ecosystem. As part of the DFK Chain, --- Finance aims at giving its users an option to provide additional liquidity if they choose to do so, bringing together DeFi and GameFi elements.\
The rationale behind this approach is that users aim to safeguard assets like Jewel, BTC, ETH, and stable coins while also maintaining liquidity. Simply holding these assets in a wallet may be considered less liquid. By utilizing a money market, users have the option to deposit these tokens, generate a yield, and borrow against them. This approach is both more capital-efficient and liquid compared to merely holding the assets in a wallet.

\--- Finance will also introduce Liquid staking derivatives concept on the DFK Chain, which allows the user to get Liquid staking derivatives tokens (LSD's). With LSD's users will be available to further participate in staking, while maintaining the ability to buy, sell, or trade the token, which gives more flexibility and liquidity.

\--- Finance own native token is called Sapphire and while it serves possesses multiple functions, it is planned in the future to gradually integrate it with our ---(CASINO) platform.\
\
Native tokens of --- Finance are called Sapphire and xSapphire tokens and together with the protocol their purpose is to support following functions:

* DEX
* Supplying & borrowing
* Liquid Staking
* Using our ---(CASINO) platform

\--- Finance operates as an algorithmic money market protocol and decentralized exchange (DEX) on the DFK Chain, enabling users to seamlessly swap, supply, and borrow assets with interest transactions conducted in a fully permissionless and decentralized manner. The interest rates for borrowing and supplying are determined by the market demand for the Sapphire token, and all loans are over-collateralized to ensure solvency.

The overarching vision of --- Finance is to establish itself as the premier money market protocol on the DFK Chain, offering supplying and borrowing services for various assets within the DFK Chain ecosystem. As a part of the DFK Chain ecosystem, --- Finance strives to provide users with the option to contribute additional liquidity, bridging the realms of DeFi and GameFi.\
The rationale behind this approach is that users aim to safeguard assets like Jewel, BTC, ETH, and stable coins while also maintaining liquidity. Simply holding these assets in a wallet may be considered less liquid. By utilizing a money market, users have the option to deposit these tokens, generate a yield, and borrow against them. This approach is both more capital-efficient and liquid compared to merely holding the assets in a wallet.

\--- Finance is set to introduce a Liquid Staking derivatives option, enabling users to acquire Liquid staking derivatives (LSD'S). With LSD's, users can actively participate in staking and earning rewards while retaining the flexibility to buy, sell, or trade the LSD token, enhancing overall flexibility and liquidity.

As the inaugural money market protocol on the DFK Chain, --- Finance plans to gradually integrate the Sapphire token into the --- (CASINO) function.

\--- Finance protocol, together with its native tokens Sapphire and xSapphire, is aimed at providing essential functions such as:

* DEX
* Supplying & borrowing
* Liquid Staking
* Using or ---(CASINO) platform
