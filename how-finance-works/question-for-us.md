# Question for us

## Royal Vault <a href="#how-do-i-deposit" id="how-do-i-deposit"></a>

* Are we a rebase model of liquid staking or claim reward whenever user wants model of staking ? If we are making rebase token is it going to be tradeable on DEX ?

## Do we implement bounties in Vault <a href="#how-do-i-deposit" id="how-do-i-deposit"></a>

* based on this system [https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/project-info/dlp/bounties](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/project-info/dlp/bounties)
* it would also require to make page that monitors disqualification bounties
* this would also allow us to give users option of auto-monitoring their 10% Vault threshold by giving them an option to enable auto-relock of xSapphire to maintain 10% threshold, if the users have enough of xSapphire in their wallet (based on this system [https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/project-info/manage-radiant/relock-dlp](https://docs.radiant.capital/radiant/project-info/manage-radiant/relock-dlp))

## Supply/borrow size <a href="#is-there-a-minimum-or-maximum-amount-to-deposit" id="is-there-a-minimum-or-maximum-amount-to-deposit"></a>

### Is there a supply minimum/maximum ? SUPPLY <a href="#is-there-a-minimum-or-maximum-amount-to-deposit" id="is-there-a-minimum-or-maximum-amount-to-deposit"></a>

There are no strict minimum or maximum supply limits. <mark style="color:red;">(option I)</mark>

There are no strict minimum supply limits, however in the initial phases of protocol we will limit maximum supplies that users can supply to a single asset at  $ ?  worth of assets and set a total supply limit of one asset in the supply and borrow pool due to concerns of liquidity and rewards distribution at the launch/early stage of the protocol. <mark style="color:red;">(option II)</mark>

### Should we set a minimu borrow amount ? BORROW&#x20;

### How does xSapphire and Vault locking interact with one another ? Is there a conflict between smart contracts

### xSAPPHIRE QUESTIONS

* xSAPPHIRE Public Sale (lock period 1 year, after which you can redeem it with Sapphire by 1:1 + in a given vesting schedule that is linear for 1 or 2 years) &#x20;
* xSAPPHIRE CANNOT BE SOLD - not an LSD ? Maybe think about making it, so we can make market for it as well (but we will spread liquidity) ?
* Mint question - are Sapphire in treasury already minted or we are minting Sapphire with only xSapphire ?
* Can we divide stakers that stake xSapphire for more then 12 months, if we can we allow them to collect protocol fees ? And for the one that stake less then 12 months their is no protocol fees.
* ARE SAPPHIRE AND xSAPPHIRE worth the same ? If xSapphire cannot be traded it doesnt matter
