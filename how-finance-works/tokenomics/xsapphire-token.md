# xSAPPHIRE token

### <mark style="color:red;">xSAPPHIRE Public Sale (lock period 1 year, after which you can redeem it with Sapphire by 1:1 + in a given vesting schedule that is linear for 1 or 2 years)</mark>&#x20;

### <mark style="color:red;">If we mint 1B for every xSapphire that we give we have to decrease the ammount of total Sapphire</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">xSAPPHIRE CANNOT BE SOLD - not an LSD ? Maybe think about making it, so we can make market for it as well (but we will spread liquidity) ?</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">Mint question - are Sapphire in treasury already minted or we are minting Sapphire with only xSapphire ?</mark>

### <mark style="color:red;">Can we divide stakers that stake xSapphire for more then 12 months, if we can we allow them to collect protocol fees ? And for the one that stake less then 12 months their is no protocol fees.</mark>

#### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Main function of xSapphire is to mint (is this mint or acquire) Sapphire. Also xSapphire serves as a token that collects protocol fees and for Vault staking that allows users to unlock higher interest rates on supplied assets or to pay lower borrowing interest rates on borrowed assets (this is only USDC in all scenarios ?).\
The xSapphire holds significantly greater value when used in synergy with the Vault.

\
Main functions of xSapphire on the protocol are:

* to mint (is this mint ?) Sapphire
* collect protocol fees (if xSapphire is staked for 12 months or more in the Vault)
* stake it into Vault to unlock higher interest rates on supplied assets or pay lower borrowing interest rates on borrowed assets (borrowed asset can only be USDC ?)
* collect Sapphire from used raffle tickets re-distribution process on our (CASINO) platform (planned to launch Q2 2025)
* governance/voting rights (which will be available in the future - Q4 2024 in the roadmap)\
  \
  <mark style="color:red;">(option I)</mark>



The primary roles of xSapphire within the protocol include:

* minting Sapphire.
* accumulating protocol fees (25% of total protocol fees are allocated to xSapphire holders if they have staked their xSapphire for minimum of 12 months in the Vault)
* staking in the Vault to unlock higher interest rates for supplied assets or to reduce borrowing interest rates for borrowed assets (borrowed asset can only be USDC ?)
* collect Sapphire through the redistribution process of spent raffle tickets on our (CASINO) platform (planned to launch Q2 2025)
* obtaining governance/voting rights (which are slated for availability in the future as per stated in the roadmap scheduled for Q4 2024)\

  <mark style="color:red;">(option II)</mark>

### How to obtain xSapphire

As an asset native to our platform, users have two avenues to obtain this multifunctional token on our platform:

* purchasing it during our public sale
* lock their Sapphire for a minimum period of 1 month up to 36 months

**By acquiring xSapphire, either by purchasing it on public sale or locking Sapphire token, we want to ensure that we reward those who are invested in the protocols long-term visions.**

#### **Withdrawal** <a href="#why-xtranq" id="why-xtranq"></a>

**If emergency withdrawal is initiated 80% of xSapphire will be converted to Sapphire and sent to Treasury while 20% of xSapphire will be given back to user as liquid Sapphire.**

#### **Why x**SAPPHIRE**?** <a href="#why-xtranq" id="why-xtranq"></a>

The intent of xSAPPHIRE is to smoothly distribute the supply of SAPPHIRE over time, preventing a huge amount of the token from being introduced to the market at once. xSAPPHIRE staking rewards will gradually provide stakers with a steady supply of SAPPHIRE in addition to their redeemable SAPPHIRE after lockup. We believe this design promotes healthier market dynamics. Staking emissions are deliberately longer than the lock up duration to incentive keeping xSAPPHIRE locked even after the lockup period ends. Because the rewards are constant per block, anyone who unstakes from the pool will increase the rewards going to the remaining stakers. This dynamic disincentivizes stakers from redeeming xSAPPHIRE all at once after the lockup period ends. <mark style="color:red;">(option I)</mark>\
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
The aim of xSAPPHIRE is to systematically distribute the SAPPHIRE supply over time, preventing a large influx of tokens into the market simultaneously. Through xSAPPHIRE staking rewards, participants will gradually receive a continuous stream of SAPPHIRE, alongside redeemable SAPPHIRE following the lockup period. This design is intended to foster healthier market dynamics. The staking emissions are deliberately set to extend beyond the lockup duration, encouraging stakeholders to keep xSAPPHIRE locked even post-lockup. As the rewards remain constant per block, individuals unstaking from the pool will augment the rewards for the remaining stakers. This dynamic discourages stakers from redeeming xSAPPHIRE all at once once the lockup period concludes. <mark style="color:red;">(option II)</mark>
