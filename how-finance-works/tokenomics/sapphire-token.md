### &#x20;<a href="#emissions" id="emissions"></a>

### Emissions <a href="#emissions" id="emissions"></a>

We won't adhere to a hard emission curve but rather, our approach revolves around prudently harmonizing the growth of the token supply with incentive rewards aimed at attracting liquidity and users that will follow Sapphire token  as time progresses and protocol keep building up. The xSAPPHIRE public sale exemplifies this guiding philosophy. Drawing from insights gained from other protocols, it's common for substantial funds that are airdropped or farmed to be promptly dumped, without a genuine commitment to the project's long-term interests. Our intention is for the allocation of incentive rewards to span a minimum of three years.



For option II emission&#x20;

Emissions schedule would be set that every month 100,000 Sapphire, which is 0.01% of total token supply, is released to the holders of xSapphire based on the amount of xSapphire they hold.\
In the case that treasury funds drop to 50% of the total supply of the token, emission would be cut in half to 0.005% of total supply or 50,000 Sapphire every month to the holders of xSapphire.\
If the treasury goes below 30% of total supply it will stop emitting Sapphire.



### Single staking

For the users that don't feel comfortable locking their assets for longer periods of time, this will be the most suitable option since they can stake and unstake their Sapphire without locking.

Although you can unstake at anytime without penalty, you will receive less rewards and no protocol fees.





### What happens with the Sapphires that are used on (CASINO) platform as entry tickets (option I)

### The Sapphires used on our (CASINO) platform as entry tickets will be re-distributed in the following way (option II)

* 25% for the holders of xSapphire based on their ammount of xSapphire
* 50% to the treasury
* 5% to the team
* 10% burned
* 10% to the Sapphire/USDC LP
