# Advanced things - Flash loans, Maturity and NFT on supply and borrow

## What is a Flash Loan?

Flash loans are a feature designed for developers, due to the technical knowledge required to execute one. Flash Loans allow you to borrow any available amount of assets without putting up any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one block transaction. To do a Flash Loan, you will need to build a contract that requests a Flash Loan. The contract will then need to execute the instructed steps and pay back the loan + interest and fees all within the same transaction.&#x20;

## Is there a fee?

**Yes**, Flash Loans have a fee of **0.09%**.
