# What is DEX ?

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a P2P marketplace connecting cryptocurrency buyers and sellers, operating without intermediaries and using smart contracts on the blockchain for trustless transactions. Users can access DEXs through web interfaces, desktop apps, or mobile apps, trading cryptocurrency pairs. DEXs are non-custodial, allowing users to retain control of private keys. Advantages include custody control, diverse token access, trustless transactions, lower fees, and privacy. However, challenges include scalability issues, complex user experiences, liquidity concerns, and limited fiat on/off-ramps.

Traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs) serve as custodians, controlling private keys and offering security and trust. In contrast, DEXs provide a decentralized alternative, utilizing smart contracts for trustless transactions. DEXs have gained popularity, accounting for a significant portion of global trade volume. They offer custody control, diversity in token access, trustless transactions, and lower fees compared to CEXs. However, challenges such as scalability issues, complex user experiences, and limited fiat on/off-ramps still hinder widespread adoption. The future of exchanges involves refining user experiences, improving infrastructure, enhancing scaling mechanisms, and establishing connections with centralized crypto and legacy financial institutions for broader adoption.
