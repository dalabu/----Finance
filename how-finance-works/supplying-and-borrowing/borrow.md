### What are the benefits of borrowing your assets ? <a href="#why-would-i-borrow-instead-of-selling-my-assets" id="why-would-i-borrow-instead-of-selling-my-assets"></a>

Liquidating your assets involves closing your position on the specific asset. Therefore, if you have a long position on the asset, you forfeit the potential gain in its value. Borrowing provides a means to access liquidity or working capital without the need to sell your assets. Users typically borrow for unforeseen expenses, to leverage their holdings, or to seize new investment opportunities.

### How can I borrow and how much can I borrow ? <a href="#how-do-i-borrow" id="how-do-i-borrow"></a>

Prior to borrowing, it is essential to first deposit an asset to serve as collateral (see the "How to supply ?" section above). Following this, proceed to the Borrow market section and select "Borrow" USDC. Determine the amount you require based on the deposits you have made, which will be utilized as collateral for the loan.

The maximum borrowing limit is contingent on both the amount deposited and the accessible liquidity. If your health rating falls below the required level or if there is insufficient liquidity, borrowing will not be feasible.

### How do I repay the asset I borrowed ? <a href="#with-what-asset-do-i-need-to-repay" id="with-what-asset-do-i-need-to-repay"></a>

In order to repay your loan you need to do it by repaying the same asset you initially borrowed. If you borrowed 1 JEWEL you need to pay back 1 JEWEL  plus interest accrued (that increases by time until the moment you repay your loan).&#x20;

### How do I know what the interest rates are when borrowing ? <a href="#how-much-would-i-pay-in-interest" id="how-much-would-i-pay-in-interest"></a>

The interest rate applicable to your borrowed assets is determined by the borrowing rate, which is influenced by the supply and demand dynamics of the asset. Additionally, a variable interest rate undergoes continuous fluctuations, while a stable interest rate ensures a consistent level of stability in interest rates. You can always check your current borrowing rate in the Borrowings section of your dashboard.

### What is the Borrow limit ? <a href="#what-is-the-health-factor" id="what-is-the-health-factor"></a>

The borrow limit serves as an indicator of the safety of your deposited assets in relation to the borrowed assets and their underlying value. A lower percentage indicates a safer condition for your funds in the event of liquidation. When the health factor hits 100%, it triggers the liquidation of your deposits. A Health Factor at 100% makes liquidation possible. The health factor is influenced by the liquidation threshold of your collateral compared to the total value of your borrowed USDC. For more details about Liquidation scenarios see the page below.

The health factor adjusts based on the fluctuation in the value of your deposits. An increase in the health factor enhances your borrowing position, making it less likely to reach the liquidation threshold. Conversely, if the value of your collateralized assets against the borrowed asset decreases, the health factor decreases as well, elevating the risk of liquidation.\

To avoid a decline in your health factor that could lead to liquidation, you have two options: repay the loan or deposit additional assets to boost your health factor. Between these two choices, repaying the loan would result in a more substantial increase in your health factor.

### What is the repayment process for the loan ? <a href="#how-do-i-pay-back-the-loan" id="how-do-i-pay-back-the-loan"></a>

To repay the loan, navigate to the Borrowing markets on your dashboard and click on the "Repay" button for the borrowed asset you wish to settle. Specify the amount for repayment and confirm the transaction.

There is no specified timeframe for repaying the loan. You can borrow for an indefinite period as long as your position remains secure. However, over time, the accrued interest will accumulate, causing your health factor to decrease. This could potentially increase the likelihood of your deposited assets facing liquidation.
