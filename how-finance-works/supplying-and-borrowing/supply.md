Earnings depends on multiple factors: mainly price of Sapphire token, the amount of users supplying the asset, maturity of your supplying position and by the average borrow rate and utilization rate of the asset

Each asset has its own APY, evolving over time based mostly on the market conditions mentioned here:

* Average borrow rate and utilization rate of the asset

There are no strict minimum or maximum supply limits. <mark style="color:red;">(option I)</mark>

There are no strict minimum supply limits, however in the initial phases of protocol we will limit maximum supplies that users can supply to a single asset at  $ ?  worth of assets and set a total supply limit of one asset in the supply and borrow pool due to concerns of liquidity and rewards distribution at the launch/early stage of the protocol. <mark style="color:red;">(option II)</mark>
