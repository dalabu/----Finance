# Questions for DFK

1. What is the process for whitelisting us to make a protocol on the DFK Chain ? + \
   \- We are good here, already talked with MrZipper
2. Do they like the idea of what our projects has to offer ?
3. Are they ok with our idea of liquid staking and stJewel that will be directly interacting with their Jeweler contract ? And if answer is yes can they help us/work with us on making sure that contracts is executed and works well ?
4. We know their validators are private, do they have plans of changing this ? This question is directed towards liquid staking of Jewel, which could be done in a simpler way if we could make a route of people staking Jewel directly to the validators where they will get a share of the rewards for the staking.
5. Can we use their validators and stake Jewel in order to collect profit for users and platform ?\*
6. Can we reroute our swaps/dex trades to Defi Kingdoms DEX  with a small cut ?
7. In the future when our ideas prove to be working and community finds utility in our protocol, we would like to explore the idea of getting a ticker on stJewel/Jewel LP via Defi Kingdoms ?
8. Oracle, when is SupraOracles data feed and dVRF coming live on DFK Chain ? Really important !!!
9. Is cJewel/sJewel intended to exist only inside DefiKingdoms ? If no, we would like to explore ideas how we could use cJewel/sJewel to further make them liquid ? We hear the idea that it might be tradable in the future. \
   Our idea would be to use cJewel to stake it on our platform/tokenize it ???
10. Do we need to implement our own SupraOracles or DFK Chain provides that service for us by using the chain ?
